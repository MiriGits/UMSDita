        <p class="p">To help us deliver to the correct destination, be sure that your delivery address is correct by creating a PLocation Code for EACH LOCATION you plan to send orders to.</p>
        <p class="p">Your PLocation Code is the unique number stored in EFS and with the U Market supplier. It references your shipping address in a specific format.</p>    
        <p class="p">If you have any questions, please contact U Market Customer Support at 612-624-4878 or umarket@umn.edu.</p>
